# RolePlayScene (client-side branching story builder)

A 100% front-end tool (HTML/CSS/JS) for building and playing simple branching role-play stories. Creators can define up to **20 scenes** (exactly **1 Start**, up to **3 Endings**, the rest Intermediate). Each scene supports **1 image**, **up to 2 dialogue lines** (each may include optional audio), and **up to 3 response choices** that branch to other scenes. No server—everything runs in the browser. Projects can be **exported/imported** as JSON and are **autosaved** to IndexedDB while you work.

## ✨ Features
- **Edit Mode**: graph canvas + inspector to add scenes, set Start/End, upload image/MP3s, author dialogue & choices, connect branches.
- **Play Mode**: left **Stage** shows scene image; right **Dialogue** auto-steps lines (with audio); then shows choices to branch.
- **Validation**: exactly 1 Start; ≤3 Endings; ≤20 scenes; no broken links; warns on unreachable scenes.
- **Storage**: Autosave to IndexedDB with graceful fallbacks; manual export/import via JSON.
- **Privacy**: all processing happens locally in the browser.
- **Mobile friendly**: touch targets, iOS autoplay guard (“Start Playback”).
- **A11y**: keyboard navigation, visible focus, text captions with audio.

## 🧱 Tech & architecture
- **No build required**: vanilla ES modules + CSS.
- **Local preview**: any static file server (e.g. `npx http-server public -p 4173`).
- **Data**: project state kept in memory and mirrored to IndexedDB; export/import as JSON snapshots.
- **Audio**: HTMLAudio (simple) with user-gesture gate; can upgrade to Web Audio API for fine control later.
- **Graph**: lightweight node/edge model; pan/zoom canvas.

## 🗃️ Data model snapshot

### In-memory project shape
```js
{
  meta: { title: 'My Role Play', version: 1 },
  scenes: [{
    id: 'scene-001',
    type: 'start' | 'intermediate' | 'end',
    image: {
      name: 'start.png',
      objectUrl: 'blob:https://…',
      blob: File | Blob | null,
    } | null,
    backgroundAudio: {
      name: 'loop.mp3',
      objectUrl: 'blob:https://…',
      blob: File | Blob | null,
    } | null,
    dialogue: [{
      text: 'Hello!',
      audio: {
        name: 'hello.mp3',
        objectUrl: 'blob:https://…',
        blob: File | Blob | null,
      } | null,
    }],
    choices: [{ id: 'choice-1', label: 'Yes', nextSceneId: 'scene-002' }],
    autoNextSceneId: null,
    notes: '',
  }],
  assets: [],
}
```

### Serialized for persistence / export
```json
{
  "meta": { "title": "My Role Play", "version": 1 },
  "scenes": [{
    "id": "scene-001",
    "type": "start",
    "image": { "name": "start.png" },
    "backgroundAudio": null,
    "dialogue": [{ "text": "Hello!", "audio": { "name": "hello.mp3" } }],
    "choices": [{ "id": "choice-1", "label": "Yes", "nextSceneId": "scene-002" }],
    "autoNextSceneId": null,
    "notes": ""
  }],
  "assets": []
}
```

## ✅ Validation rules
- Exactly **1** scene marked `type = "start"`.
- **0–3** scenes marked `type = "end"`.
- **1–20** total scenes.
- Each choice must reference an existing `nextSceneId`.
- Every non-Start scene must be reachable from Start.
- End scenes cannot have outgoing choices.

## 🧭 User flows
**Edit Mode** → create scenes, mark Start/End, add dialogue (≤2 lines), add choices (≤3), connect edges, Validate, Save/Export.  
**Play Mode** → Start Playback → show image & dialogue (with audio) → show choices → transition → reach End.

## 🔈 Audio considerations
Autoplay is gated by a user gesture; provide Mute/Unmute and Replay controls; preload next scene assets.

## ♿ Accessibility
Keyboard navigation, focus styles, ARIA roles, visible captions.

## 📱 Browser support
Latest Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari. iOS Safari requires an initial tap for audio.

## 🚀 Getting started (dev)
1. Install a recent Node.js runtime (18+) for running tests.
2. Start a static server from the repo root, e.g. `npx http-server public -p 4173` or `python -m http.server 4173 --directory public`.
3. Visit `http://localhost:4173` and the app will boot into Edit mode after setting up persistence.

## 🧪 Testing
- Run all unit tests: `for f in tests/*.test.mjs; do echo "Running $f"; node "$f"; done`
- Key coverage includes model helpers, validators, and IndexedDB serialization/hydration round-trips.

## 🔒 Security & privacy
No network calls; media handled locally; warn on export.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
PWA, undo/redo, graph screenshot, shareable self-contained HTML player, local analytics.
